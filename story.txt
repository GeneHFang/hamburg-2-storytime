After enjoying four beers and four bratwursts, my mind will start coming up with nothing but schnapsidee. 
For example, what if there was Luftschloss, a really big one, and we used that location for wettbewerbsfaehig games.
The flughafen would provide a one-way ticket to the luftschloss and the only way to return home would be to win.
If you lose, then you will be put in a BMW with musik at max levels for an hour.
