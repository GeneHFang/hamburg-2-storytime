After enjoying four beers and four bratwursts, his mind would start coming up with nothing but schnapsidee. 
For example, what if there was Luftschloss, a really big one, and we used that location for wettbewerbsfaehig games.
The flughafen would provide a one-way ticket to the luftschloss and the only way to return home would be to win.
If you lose, then you will be put in a BMW with musik at max levels for an hour.
If you win, you also will be awarded the coveted Dirndel and Lederhose combo.
These clothes grant you access to basically any ratskeller north of Germany.
The most important aspect of this luftschloss is the unlimited biergarten drinks.
This is the kopfkino that he has to deal with on a daily basis.
The best remedy to calm his mind is to blast the klimaanlage into his face.
The only other remedy known to him is to listen to Rammstein musik.
